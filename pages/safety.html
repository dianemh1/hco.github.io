		  <p class="text-justify">Peace River closely follows the USDA Good Agricultural Practices and Good Handing Practices (GAP/GHP) for our management of farming, harvesting, packing, and storage of citrus fruit.  In addition, we also implement the USDA and FDA Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) approach to indentifying risks for food contamination as well as measures for prevention.  Our goal is to continuously improve and always exceed the standards of the industry, which is why we regularly perform internal audits and inspections of our facilities, farms, and records in addition to receiving annual third party audits. </p>
