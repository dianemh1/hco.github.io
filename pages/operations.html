	<h1>Operations</h1>
	<p class="lead text-justify">The journey of an orange to the grocery store always begins with a single tree.  Much care goes into producing a single piece of fruit and Peace River Packing is there at every step.  It begins with years of nurturing a tree to fruit bearing age, then selecting just the right moment to harvest when the fruit has the perfect combination of sweetness and flavor, and finally ending when we carefully harvest, clean, and protect the citrus fruit before it makes its way to our customers.</p>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Harvesting </h2>
		<p class="text-justify">Picking fruit safely and at peak maturity is critical to deliver the highest quality product to our customers. Unlike bananas or avocados, citrus fruit do not ripen off the tree; instead, the flavor of the fruit is essentially the same as the day it was harvested. To have the best tasting orange, tangerine, or grapefruit, you must pick at season's peak. This requires a combination of skill, science, and good ole farmer experience!</p>

		<div class="col-md-8">
			<p class="text-justify">Citrus packing is all about protecting the fruit so it arrives to you clean, and as fresh as if you just picked the fruit from the tree.  Peace River follows a safe, scientifically sound, and time-tested process for postharvest care of citrus that keeps the fruit fresh and tasty.  Our process involves grading, washing, waxing, packing, and refrigeration.</p>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Grading</dt><dd>Where we remove any fruit that does not meet USDA Grade #1 standards</dd>
				<dt>Washing</dt><dd>Gives the fruit a nice appearance and ensures the peel is safe for consumption</dd>
				<dt>Waxing</dt><dd>Natural carnauba wax prevents the fruit from drying and prolongs shelf life</dd>
				<dt>Packing</dt><dd>Carefully packing the citrus fruit into a bag or carton</dd>

		<h2 class="featurette-heading">Sustainability</h2>
		<div class="col-md-9">
			<p class="text-justify">As a family owned co-op of growers, many of the groves we harvest today were planted years ago by our parents and grandparents. We realize that our livelihood today was only made possible by their efforts and sacrifices as farmers, and that we too have a duty to protect and nurture the land for our children. Unlike annual crops such as corn, strawberries, and tomatoes, citrus trees take three to five years bear fruit and much longer to actually produce a crop that will be profitable. Success in the citrus business requires a long-term sustainability commitment, a commitment not just to the trees, our employees, the ground water that sustains us, and the community in which we live and work. </p>
			<h4>Some of our sustainability initiatives:</h4>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal">
				<dt>Integrated Pest Management</dt><dd>Following the principles of IPM, we reduce pest damage to our trees and crops while limiting our impact on the environment.</dd>
				<dt>Water Conservation</dt><dd>To conserve water we use low volume spray jets, which apply water directly to a tree’s root zone.  Low volume spray jets are also energy efficient.</dd>
				<dt>Energy Conservation</dt><dd>In our packinghouse, we installed high efficiency refrigeration units for our cooler, added motion sensor lighting for our offices, and converted our boiler from diesel to clean burning natural gas.</dd>
				<dt>Cultivation Technology</dt><dd>We conserve resources and cut down on nutrient runoff by using high tech spreaders that detect and apply fertilizer only to the root zone of a tree.</dd>
